        <h1>About</h1>
        <section id="aboutMe">
            <p>     My name is Ben Heil and I am a 20 year old musician from Colorado, currently attending Loyola University New Orleans, where I study Popular and Commercial Music.  I am the leader of a band: Planet of the Little Green Men. Planet of the Little Green Men are a Psychedelic Rock band based in New Orleans, LA. As musicians from all over the United States and beyond, we strive to push the boundaries of modern music and evolve the lens in which we listen to and contemplate the musical world around us. 
                Psychedelic, intricate, unconventional, and exciting are just a few words to describe LGM's Music. Taking influence from modern Psychedelic Rock Bands such as King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, Osees, as well as old favorites like The Beatles and Pink Floyd, Planet of the Little Green Men dream of merging classic music templates with fresh, new musical ideas to create a unique and thoughtful musical experience.  We hope that one day soon you can experience us for yourself!</p>
